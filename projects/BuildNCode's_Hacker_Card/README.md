# Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am building a Hacker Card that can read NFC code. It also can act as a buisiness card.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$39.19 is the price normally, but with my $10 coupon, it would be $28.43 (Because sales tax would change)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
