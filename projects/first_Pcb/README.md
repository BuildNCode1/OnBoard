#First PCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am building a simple board that can transfer power from a usb-c cord to a usb-a cord. The board itself is in the shape of one of my favorite animals: a fox. This is my very first PCB that I have created, and I'm excited to continue building and learning!
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost $66.28, including shipping.
<!--Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Since it was my first time using the software of JLCPCB, I naturally had no idea how to use it. I didn't know how to switch my designs from schematic to PCB or 3D model. But a few instructional videos later, I got the hang of it.
